# SynScene: Synthetic Dataset for Natural Scene Text Recognition
Welcome to the SynScene Git repository! This project contains the Python code for generating a synthetic dataset designed for natural scene text recognition tasks. The SynScene dataset includes approximately 1.5 million images, all featuring text in the Persian language.

## Overview
Natural scene text recognition is a crucial task in the field of computer vision, with applications ranging from automated reading systems to enhancing accessibility. The SynScene dataset aims to provide a robust and diverse set of synthetic images to facilitate research and development in this area, particularly focusing on the Persian language.

## Dataset Details
* **Text Sources**: The text used in the dataset is derived from the Tabnak dataset, random Iranian phone numbers, and incremental numbers.

* **Backgrounds**: Images feature backgrounds from the [OpenImage dataset](https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/web/index.html) or colored backgrounds, ensuring a variety of contexts and scenes.

* **Image Variations**: The dataset incorporates various random noise and transformations, including:
* Salt and Pepper noise
* Rotation
* Shearing
* Piecewise Affine transformation
* CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization)
* Perspective Transform
* Blur

* **Color Format**: All images are stored in RGB format.

## Features
* **Persian Language Text**: All images in the SynScene dataset feature text in the Persian language, catering to specific linguistic research needs.

## Repository Contents

* **Data Generation Scripts**: Python scripts used to generate the SynScene dataset, allowing for customization and further expansion.
* **Sample Images**: A subset of sample images from the SynScene dataset to provide an overview of the dataset's content and quality.
* **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation detailing the data generation process, usage instructions, and dataset specifications.
